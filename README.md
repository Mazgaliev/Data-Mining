Analysing the data measurements from architects for tunnel deformations

Analysis of the measurements made from the architects considering tunnel quality along with some metrics that they have for said quality of these tunnels. 
In this project I’ve used different Data Mining techniques and methods to analyse all the attributes and their correlations between each other and with the predictor values.
I’ve done visualizations, feature selections, significance tests and experiments to see whether the models perform better with certain features. I’ve used different ML models, regressions linear regressions, polynomial, lasso, ridge, decision tree regressors, ensembles (XGB, Random Forests) and Deep Neural Networks. 
For classification on this project I’ve explored logistic regression, LDA, QDA, Support vector machines, decision trees, ensembles and Neural Networks. As well as understanding all the metrics that give meaning to the results given by the models.
